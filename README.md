# 311 Complaints Analysis Project

This project aims to analyze the most common complaints from a city and determine the exact locations where they occurred. It also investigates the officials who were in charge of the city based on the complaints data. The dataset used in this analysis is real complaint data obtained from the US government website.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract insights from the complaint data to understand the major issues faced by the city residents and identify the areas that require attention from city officials. The analysis will include the following steps:

1. Data Gathering: Scraping the complaint data from the us.gov website.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the raw data to remove duplicates and irrelevant information.
3. Complaint Analysis: Identifying the most common types of complaints and their frequency.
4. Geolocation Analysis: Mapping the exact locations where the complaints were registered.
5. Official Analysis: Determining the officials in charge of the city during the time of the complaints.
6. Creating Reusable Code: Utilizing MITO.AI, an AI tool, to develop reusable code for future analysis.

## Installation

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the main script `my first project.ipynb` to execute the analysis.

## Usage

Modify the script's settings and parameters to adapt it to your specific needs. You can customize the analysis by changing the source of the complaint data, adjusting the timeframe, or applying additional filters.

## Acknowledgements

We would like to express our gratitude to the US government for providing the complaint data used in this project. We also thank the MITO.AI platform for enabling us to create reusable code and streamline our analysis process.
